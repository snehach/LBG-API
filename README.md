## Testing

To run test on this project, use the command

~~~ bash
$ npm test
~~~

### Example tests

#### Unit Testing

There is a unit test included in this project, we are testing the item builder for the object that it returns.

If we test the builder and input a name of "item", a description of "test description", a price of 99 and a id of 4... We can expect an object to be created that matches this format.

~~~ Javascript
{
    name : "item",
    description : "test description",
    price : 99,
    _id : 4
}
~~~

#### Integration test

An example of integration test that we can created for this project is to test the RESTful endpoint.

If we test the DELETE endpoint by sending a request with a method of 'DELETE' and a path of '/delete/1' we should expect the response to be:

Status code: 200
Status text : OK

#### System Testing

For system integration testing, we could test our CREATE method for our project, and check that the output from READ method is expected.

Alternatively, we can black box system test, by using the front end to create an item and reading the page to make sure the new product has been created.

#### User acceptance testing

*As a* user
*When* I enter a product id into the delete field and press the delete button
*I want* the item to be deleted

converting above to something like Gerkin script:
*GIVEN* a user can access the front-end of the application
*WHEN* they input an id into the delete item input
*AND* an item with that id exists
*AND* they press the delete item button
*THEN* that item is deleted from the database
